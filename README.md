## 🌟 Overview & Purpose

The `rpi-4` project provides a suite of Bash scripts tailored for the Raspberry Pi 4 (though largely compatible with other Raspberry Pi models running Raspberry Pi OS/Raspbian) to enhance its performance, security, and stability, particularly for media server applications.

### What it Does

This application transforms a standard Raspberry Pi OS installation into a streamlined, headless media server platform by:

*   **Automating initial setup:** Handles common first-time configurations like user creation, SSH key setup, hostname, and localization.
*   **Optimizing system resources:** Removes unnecessary packages (like GUI components), disables unused services (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi), and tunes kernel parameters.
*   **Enhancing security:** Implements robust SSH hardening, configures a firewall, sets up intrusion detection with `fail2ban`, and establishes system auditing.
*   **Ensuring system health and data integrity:** Provides scripts for regular system health checks, package updates, and configurable backups of critical system files.

### Why it Matters

Running a media server on a Raspberry Pi is a popular and cost-effective solution. However, a default Raspberry Pi OS installation is not optimized for this purpose. It often includes desktop environments and services that consume valuable CPU, RAM, and disk I/O, hindering media streaming or file serving performance. Furthermore, security out-of-the-box can be insufficient for an always-on network device.

`rpi-4` addresses these issues by:
*   **Maximizing performance:** Freeing up resources to dedicate to media server tasks.
*   **Improving stability:** Reducing background processes and potential conflicts.
*   **Strengthening security:** Protecting your device from common network threats.
*   **Simplifying maintenance:** Automating routine tasks and providing health insights.

### Target Audience

*   **Raspberry Pi enthusiasts** looking to build a dedicated media server (e.g., using Plex, Jellyfin, Kodi, DLNA).
*   **DIY home lab users** who want to optimize their embedded systems for specific headless tasks.
*   **Anyone seeking to harden and streamline their Raspberry Pi** installation for improved performance and security.
*   **System administrators** looking for a repeatable way to deploy optimized Pi units.

## ⚡ Getting Started

This section guides you through setting up and running the `rpi-4` scripts on your Raspberry Pi.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **Raspberry Pi 4 (or compatible)**: While designed for Pi 4, most scripts should work on Pi 3B+, 3A+, 3B, and newer models running **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit or 32-bit)**.
*   **Fresh Raspberry Pi OS Installation**: It's highly recommended to start with a fresh install of Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian) to avoid conflicts with existing configurations. The **Lite** version is preferred as it has no desktop environment.
*   **SSH Access**: You should be able to connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH. The default username is `pi` and password `raspberry` (change this immediately!).
*   **Internet Connection**: Your Raspberry Pi needs an active internet connection to download packages and updates.
*   **`sudo` privileges**: All scripts require `root` or `sudo` privileges to execute.

> [!WARNING]
> These scripts make significant changes to your system. **Always back up critical data** before running them, especially on a production system. A fresh OS installation is recommended.

### Installation

1.  **Connect via SSH**:
    ```bash
    ssh pi@your_rpi_ip_address
    ```

2.  **Update your system (recommended first step on any new install)**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
    sudo reboot # Reboot if kernel or critical system components were updated
    ```

3.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/WomB0ComB0/rpi-4.git
    cd rpi-4
    ```

4.  **Make scripts executable**:
    ```bash
    chmod +x *.sh
    ```

### Configuration

Some scripts (like `cleanup.sh` and `health_backup.sh`) have configurable variables at the top of the script files. You can edit these directly to suit your needs before running them.

For `cleanup.sh`:
*   `INSTALL_MEDIA_SERVER_SOFTWARE`: Set to `true` to enable automatic installation of specified media server packages.
*   `MEDIA_SERVER_PACKAGES`: Uncomment or add packages you wish to install.
    ```bash
    # Example snippet from cleanup.sh
    INSTALL_MEDIA_SERVER_SOFTWARE=false # Set to true and edit the list below to auto-install

    MEDIA_SERVER_PACKAGES=(
        #"minidlna"
        #"transmission-daemon"
        #"samba" # If you need network shares (SMB/CIFS)
        # "plexmediaserver" # Often requires manual download/install
        # "jellyfin" # Often requires manual setup of repositories
    )
    ```

For `health_backup.sh`:
*   `BACKUP_PATHS`: Specify the directories you want to back up.
*   `BACKUP_DEST`: Define the destination for your backup archives.
*   `MAX_BACKUPS`: Control the number of old backups to retain.
*   `ENCRYPT_BACKUP`: Set to `true` and provide a `GPG_RECIPIENT_EMAIL` for encrypted backups.

> [!TIP]
> Always review the script content, especially the configuration sections, to understand what changes will be made and to customize it for your specific setup.

### Running the Scripts

The scripts are designed to be run as `root` (e.g., using `sudo`).

#### Development

For testing or development, you can run individual scripts directly.

```bash
sudo ./cleanup.sh
sudo ./sec.sh
# etc.
```

#### Production

For a full system setup, follow the recommended workflow outlined in the [Usage & Workflows](#️-usage--workflows) section. `health_backup.sh` is typically scheduled as a cron job for production environments.

## 🛠️ Usage & Workflows

This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the `rpi-4` scripts to achieve a fully optimized and secure Raspberry Pi media server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always run these scripts from within the `rpi-4` directory after cloning the repository.
> `cd ~/rpi-4`

### Initial Setup Workflow (Recommended)

This workflow assumes a fresh installation of Raspberry Pi OS Lite and guides you through the process of setting up your system from scratch.

#### Step 1: Initial System Setup (`setup.sh`)

This script handles basic system configurations and sets up a secure way to access your Pi.

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> This script is highly interactive. It will prompt you for:
> *   Creating a new user (recommended to replace `pi`).
> *   Setting up SSH keys for passwordless login.
> *   Configuring your hostname, timezone, and locale.
> *   Disabling the default `pi` user if a new admin user is created.
>
> Follow the prompts carefully. You might be asked to reboot after this step to apply hostname changes and new user configurations.

#### Step 2: Optimize & Clean (`cleanup.sh`)

After the initial setup and reboot (if required), run `cleanup.sh` to remove bloat and optimize for performance.

```bash
sudo ./cleanup.sh
```

> [!TIP]
> This script offers several interactive choices:
> *   **Remove GUI/Desktop packages:** Choose `y` if you're building a headless server.
> *   **Disable wireless services (WiFi/Bluetooth):** Choose `y` if your Pi is wired (Ethernet).
> *   **Optimize for maximum performance:** Choose `y` for media server tasks.
> *   **Set up automatic security updates:** Highly recommended to choose `y`.
>
> Before running, you can customize the `INSTALL_MEDIA_SERVER_SOFTWARE` and `MEDIA_SERVER_PACKAGES` variables at the top of the `cleanup.sh` file to automatically install applications like `minidlna` or `transmission-daemon`.
>
> **The script will ask for a final confirmation before proceeding.** Make sure to review the summary of changes. A reboot will be performed automatically after this script completes.

#### Step 3: Harden Security (`sec.sh`)

Once your system is optimized and has rebooted, apply security hardening measures.

```bash
sudo ./sec.sh
```

> [!WARNING]
> The `sec.sh` script will:
> *   **Disable root SSH login.**
> *   **Disable password authentication for SSH** if SSH keys are already configured via `setup.sh`. Ensure you have tested SSH key login before running this!
> *   **Configure UFW firewall.**
> *   **Install Fail2Ban.**
> *   **Install Auditd.**
>
> Make sure you understand these changes. If you haven't set up SSH keys, consider doing so with `setup.sh` first, or manually before running `sec.sh`.
> This script does not require a reboot immediately, but it's always good practice after significant security changes.

#### Step 4: Schedule Health & Backup (`health_backup.sh`)

Finally, set up continuous health monitoring and automated backups by scheduling `health_backup.sh` with `cron`.

First, edit the `health_backup.sh` script to configure your backup paths, destination, and encryption settings:

```bash
nano health_backup.sh
# Adjust BACKUP_PATHS, BACKUP_DEST, MAX_BACKUPS, ENCRYPT_BACKUP, GPG_RECIPIENT_EMAIL
```

Then, open your crontab for editing (as root):

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Add entries to run `health_backup.sh` periodically. For example, to run daily at 3:00 AM:

```cron
0 3 * * * /path/to/rpi-4/health_backup.sh >> /var/log/rpi_health_backup.log 2>&1
```
Replace `/path/to/rpi-4/` with the actual path where you cloned the repository (e.g., `/home/youruser/rpi-4/`).

> [!TIP]
> Consider running `health_backup.sh` manually once after configuration to ensure it works as expected:
> ```bash
> sudo ./health_backup.sh
> ```

### Example: Running `cleanup.sh` Interactivenly

## ⚠️ Limitations, Known Issues & Future Roadmap

This project is continuously evolving. Here's what to keep in mind and what's planned for the future.

### Current Limitations

*   **Raspberry Pi OS Specific**: While some scripts might work on other Debian-based systems, they are primarily tested and optimized for Raspberry Pi OS.
*   **Manual Media Server Installation**: For complex media server solutions like Plex Media Server or Jellyfin, the scripts currently only provide placeholders for `apt` installation. Full, automated setup often requires adding custom repositories or manual downloads/installations, which are not covered by these scripts.
*   **Backup Scope**: `health_backup.sh` performs backups of specified directories. It is not a full system image backup solution.
*   **Network Configuration**: Assumes DHCP for network setup; static IP configuration is not automated.
*   **Hardware Compatibility**: Primarily tested on Raspberry Pi 4. While likely compatible, behavior on other Pi models or different ARM boards might vary.
*   **Idempotency**: While efforts are made to ensure scripts are somewhat idempotent (running them multiple times won't break things), they are not fully designed for it. Running `cleanup.sh` or `sec.sh` multiple times *will* re-apply settings, which is generally fine, but could overwrite manual changes.

### Known Issues

*   **`rc.local` Deprecation**: The `cleanup.sh` script attempts to back up `/etc/rc.local`. Note that `rc.local` is deprecated in modern systemd-based Linux distributions and may not exist or be used. The script handles its absence gracefully with a warning.
*   **`/proc/cpuinfo` parsing**: Parsing `Model` and `Revision` from `/proc/cpuinfo` can sometimes return "Unknown" on newer OS versions or specific hardware revisions, though it's generally reliable.
*   **WiFi/Bluetooth Disablement**: Disabling wireless services (if chosen) is done via `dtoverlay` entries in `config.txt`. Ensure you have a wired connection if you select this option.

### Future Roadmap & Enhancements

*   **Enhanced Media Server Integration**: Develop more robust, opinionated installation functions for Plex, Jellyfin, and other popular media servers, including their specific repository setups.
*   **Advanced Monitoring**: Integrate with external monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana exporters) for more detailed long-term metrics.
*   **User-defined Configuration Files**: Implement a more robust configuration system (e.g., using YAML or TOML files) instead of direct script edits, allowing easier updates without merging conflicts.
*   **Interactive Menu System**: Explore a simple CLI menu (e.g., using `whiptail` or `dialog`) for a more guided user experience.
*   **Systemd Service Creation**: Automatically create `systemd` services for specific tasks where `cron` might be less ideal (e.g., ensuring a service is always running).
*   **Documentation Expansion**: Add more specific examples, troubleshooting steps, and a deeper dive into the changes made by each script.
*   **Version Control for Configs**: Option to back up modified config files to a git repository.

### FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

<details>
<summary>Q: Can I run these scripts on a non-Raspberry Pi Debian-based system?</summary>
<br>
A: While many parts of the scripts are generic to Debian-based systems, they are specifically tuned and tested for Raspberry Pi OS. Some components, like GPU memory split in `config.txt` or specific wireless module disabling, are Raspberry Pi specific. Proceed with caution and review the scripts thoroughly if attempting to use them on other hardware.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: What if I accidentally disable SSH access or my WiFi/Ethernet?</summary>
<br>
A: It's a risk when making system-wide network changes. If you lose access, you will need physical access to your Raspberry Pi, a keyboard, and a monitor to revert changes (e.g., by editing `/boot/config.txt` or `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` from the console, or restoring from the backup created by `cleanup.sh`). Always ensure you have a fallback access method or tested SSH key login before running `sec.sh` with password authentication disabled.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: How can I revert the changes made by these scripts?</summary>
<br>
A: The `cleanup.sh` script creates a backup of critical system files in `/root/system_backup_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`. You can use these files to manually revert changes. For more complex rollbacks (e.g., re-installing GUI packages), you might need to consult official Raspberry Pi OS documentation or perform a fresh OS installation.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: Do I need to run all scripts, or can I pick and choose?</summary>
<br>
A: While the full workflow is recommended for a dedicated media server, you can run individual scripts or sections as needed. For example, you might only need `sec.sh` for an existing server, or just `health_backup.sh` for maintenance. Just be aware of potential dependencies (e.g., `sec.sh` assumes SSH is already configured).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: How do I install Plex or Jellyfin after running these scripts?</summary>
<br>
A: The `cleanup.sh` script has a placeholder for common media server packages, but Plex and Jellyfin usually require adding their specific repositories and then installing. After running `cleanup.sh`, follow the official installation guides for Plex Media Server or Jellyfin for Raspberry Pi, which typically involve adding a GPG key, repository URL, and then using `apt`.
</details>

### Troubleshooting Guide

<details>
<summary>Problem: Script aborted with "apt lock" error.</summary>
<br>
**Solution**: This means another process is using `apt`.
1.  Ensure no other package managers (Synaptic, Software Updater, `apt` commands in other terminals) are running.
2.  Wait a few minutes and try again.
3.  If the problem persists, you can manually remove the lock files (use with caution!):
    ```bash
    sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend
    sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
    sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
    sudo dpkg --configure -a
    ```
    Then, try running the script again.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem: After running `cleanup.sh` and rebooting, I can't access my Pi via SSH or network.</summary>
<br>
**Possible Causes & Solutions**:
1.  **GUI Removal**: If you removed the GUI, the screen might be black, but SSH should still work.
2.  **Wireless Disabled**: If you disabled wireless services and your Pi relies on WiFi, it might lose network connectivity. Connect an Ethernet cable if possible.
3.  **SSH Hardening**: If you ran `sec.sh` (or `cleanup.sh` partially) and disabled password authentication or root login, ensure you are using the correct user and SSH key.
4.  **Firewall**: A misconfigured firewall (UFW) could block SSH. If you have physical access, try disabling UFW:
    ```bash
    sudo ufw disable
    ```
    Then try SSH again.
5.  **Corrupt `config.txt`**: If the system doesn't boot at all, the `/boot/config.txt` file might be corrupted. You may need to access the SD card from another computer to edit or restore it.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem: `health_backup.sh` reports "GPG recipient not found" or similar encryption error.</summary>
<br>
**Solution**: Ensure you have correctly configured `GPG_RECIPIENT_EMAIL` in `health_backup.sh` and that the corresponding GPG public key is imported into the `root` user's keyring on your Raspberry Pi.
1.  As root, list keys: `sudo gpg --list-keys`
2.  If the key is missing, import it: `sudo gpg --import /path/to/your/public_key.asc`
</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem: My media server software isn't working after optimization.</summary>
<br>
**Possible Causes & Solutions**:
1.  **Resource Limits**: Check `sysctl.conf` or other kernel parameters for overly aggressive settings.
2.  **Service Disabled**: Ensure the media server service itself is enabled and running (`sudo systemctl status plexmediaserver`). If `cleanup.sh` aggressively disabled services, you might need to re-enable it.
3.  **Firewall Blocking**: Check UFW status (`sudo ufw status`) and ensure the necessary ports for your media server are open (e.g., 32400 for Plex, 8096 for Jellyfin).
4.  **Permissions**: Ensure your media server has appropriate read/write permissions to your media libraries.
